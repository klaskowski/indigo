<p>I'm a Software Developer since 2012, experienced in Java and JavaScript. I took part in projects ranging from one-man army startups to enterprise level solutions. Currently, I'm  working in insurance industry, focusing on scaling microservice architecture, utilizing Kafka messaging queues and NoSQL databases over AWS services. I favors true agility over poorly implemented Scrum. His motto is: "Coding is the easiest part of the job. Even though it involves computers - it's all about people".

<p>Outside of a 9-to-5 developer job, I work as a lecturer and trainer at coding bootcamps.</p>
