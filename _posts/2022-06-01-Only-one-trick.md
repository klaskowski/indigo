I have finally figured it out. It's really just one secret. Internet gurus were not lying about that. Except the ones that claim it's "TOP 10 RULES TO BECOME RICH". Not 10 but 1. 

## Make money fast

"Make money fast" are exact words my rich friend told me once. But what does it mean? Let's take a look at an article from The Motley Fool, which says ["Missing just a few of the best stock market days could cost you big"](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/12/31/missing-just-a-few-of-the-best-stock-market-days-c/).

What the article is saying is that most of the money is being made in just few days and the rest of time, say 90-95%, people are just waiting around for that one golden opportunity, one lucky day. According to this article, if you've bought into the market ten years ago and you just "buy and hold", you'd make 6% on average per year. But actually, if you've missed the ten best days of the stock market, your returns would drop from 6% to just 2.4% per year. And if somehow you just missed 20 best days, your returns would be close to zero.

Zero over the past ten year. By simply missing 20 best days. 20 best days account for the whole 6% gains that you would have made. Hillariously enough, if you've missed 30 best days, your returns would be negative.

This gives us a clue, how money truly is made in a stock market and in the real world. We're being told it's a monthly salary that comes every month and it's fairly consistent. Rather, the money comes (and goes) in large spikes. The rest of the time is pretty flat.

Since 9-to-5 job is constantly flat, without a chance of giving you this large spike, it's not a way to make money. You can't become rich from a day job. A job is just a way to survive. Don't get me wrong. Surviving, buying your time and waiting is part of this game, as long as you're actively looking for an opportunity.

The problem is, most people think that a job IS THE opportunity and they don't even look for any other opportunities. They think by making 10%-20% more than an average person they know, is going to slowly put them in a significant lead by the compounding effect. What they don't take into account is that the rest of people are sniffing for the opportunity that is going to skyrocket them by few orders of magnitude. That's why historically nobody became significantly richer than the rest of the society by doing a 9-to-5 job. A job is a trade in which you buy stability at the cost of opportunity chance.

## "Slow money vs fast money"? There's only one money!

People who make money, they make it fast and there's no way around it. So if you think you're going to build this slow business that's going to take you 10-20 years to build, and then in your 40s or 50s you'll finally be rich, you won't. By then, you'll miss so many opportunities, because your whole focus was on your long term plan.

The first big money I made was March 2020. It took the market three weeks to drop by 30%. Climbing up the same amount of points in the past took 4 years.

I also saw few people trying to make big buck on Facebook Apps. I remember the first conference, people planning to build the new Microsoft Office on Facebook App platform. People really had grand plans about these huge businesses, thinking Facebook App is going to be like the next operating system, like Mac OS, and hence getting all their business infrastucture set up. Behemoth was slowly walking towards that goal. We know how it ended up. You don't? I believe you don't use Facebook Office. That's because they never made it. Facebook App platform fizzled out. Mobile came along, Apple came along and whiped out all these carefully planed million-dollar businesses.

What went wrong? Pride. All these developers wanted to act like legitimate businesses, with suits and briefcases, long term business plans, careful budgets. They wanted to walk into a brick and mortar office, show a powerpoint presentation to some manager while drinking morning coffee with their shiny logos on the mug. They missed all the opportunities by looking into the past. They tried to build old business in the traditional sense instead of fast moving ones that were mobile and digital.

I remember when I was at the University, I took Basics of Computer Graphics classes. It was the first time I was using Photoshop and 3D modeling tools. I had many doubts - am I doing it right? I asked my professor and he said "Just make it done. Just finish it and show me the result". And that's how everything is done, business included. You cannot look into the past and replicate how people did stuff. You can't replicate Warren Buffet or other people who made money 10-20 years ago. Brick and mortar offices, powerpoint presentations, dividend investing - these are all best ways of making money in their times. They were exactly what currently is modern digital society where money moves faster than ever before. That's why old professors and gurus can't tell you what to do today. Copying their strategy would only work if you time travel to their respective times. You have to strike fast and be result oriented. People are constantly trailblazing new frontiers for business.

Enter Flappy Bird. That game became number one in the app store in instant. 18 million dollar per year of ad revenue. If you look at how this money was made, it was a huge spike in February 2014. That was it. A single event. The game was shit. It was nothing more than an exercise of using basic controls in a game engine. But it was in the right place, at a right time. 

Where are such opportunities right now? Let's have a look at #crypto and DeFi.

## Reverse engineering the "money making" process

Undeniably, cryptocurrencies are a trend in 2021. The internet is littered with Dogecoin millionaires. They made lifechanging amount of money in about one month of time. You could say it was silly, or it was a joke, a meme, but their lifes are going to be forever changed. I'm sure you could say the same about the author of Flappybird or authors of silly Facebook apps.

What is the next opportunity? I'm going to introduce that to you.

Social tokens.

There's a reason I've joined [Big Short Bets](https://bigshortbets.com/) - that's a community-based token project. One of many. Huge wave incoming.

If you don't like the idea of becoming a millionaire, that's fine. Return to your 9-to-5 job. Go make your money the slow way in a brick and mortar store job.

How do women get wealthy?

Let's look at MacKenzie Scott. What did she do? She married Jeff Besos. That's it. All the rest of her accomplishments are insignificant. One moment made her a fortune. The rest of her life was pretty much uneventful. She used to work at finance. Not a single bilion made with her degree or skills.

Speaking of finance. I had an opportunity to follow closely a group of top-tier traders. What made them rich was usually one high-yield trade a year, with the rest of the year spent on waiting for the opportunity. When opportunity arised, they went all in, while for the rest of the time, their money was sitting outside of the market or in some safe trade, waiting for one chance.

## Sniffing opportunity

Opportunity might come at any day. It can be a day just like today. You might be just lazy around the house, reading a random blog, sitting in a pyjama, really bored out of your mind. You're going to be in a state of innertia, inactivity, when it feels like nothing is going on in the world. But that's when the opportunity comes. If you don't grab it now, it will be gone, maybe even next minute.

I'm pretty sure that in a year you'll come back to this post, thinking "That was the opportunity Krystian was talking about. I've missed it!". Opportunities are always becoming clear after a certain event when it's too late to grab them. You'll miss plenty of opportunities to change your life, just like you've missed stock investing in Apple, Google, real estate, Bitcoin, Dogecoin and all these other chances that you had but you've passed on.

It's not your fault. You've been working hard at your day job, making slow money, trying to get your promotions. It's definitely not your fault you've been missing on these opportunities.

Or is it?

## Conclusion

 Singular days, short amount of time, grabed opportunities - that's how the money is made in this world. It's not wealth accumulated over tens of years of hard service to please your boss. He will promote someone else, some newcomer with more freshness and potential. At this point people usually rage quit and switch jobs, starting this process all over again.

The true understanding usually comes after retirement, because that's when we lose our emotional attachment to our actions, to our job. We can see things clearly from a position of an innocent bystander.

Knowing that we all know now, would you sell everything and mortgage your house to buy Bitcoin in it's infancy stage?
